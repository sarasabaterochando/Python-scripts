## 🚀 Python utilities for automating data workflows. 

This repository includes scripts for secure SFTP file transfers, REST API integration, and document processing pipelines.
Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts focused on three main areas:

* 📁 Secure SFTP connections for uploading and downloading files.

* 🔧 REST API integrations to retrieve or send data between systems.

* 📄 Document processing application (Word & PDF Generator) that automates the generation of DOCX and PDF documents from an Excel file using predefined templates.

*One of the example projects related to this repository (not included here) is a Streamlit-based file processing tool. In those examples, data is fetched from an SQL database, exported to Excel, and then prepared for loading into other systems such as ERP platforms or payroll applications.*
